Dear Tom,

How are you? I hope you are doing well. I'm sorry that you couldn't come to the class reunion. We all missed
you so much. The reunion was on Monday at a restaurant called Mediterraneo. I liked the restaurant, they have
the best soup in the town. Do you remember James? He was there too. He arrived by a realy old car. He
always liked oldtimers and now he has got one. William was also there. He got a cool job, he's a police officer.
Oliver couldn't come, he became a pilot and had to fly to Japan. The next reunion will be in 5 years. I hope
i will se you on the next one.

Best,
David

Yes, I highly agree. Firstly, if you study with a private tutor, you can study at your own speed. For me this is an important thing. Secondly, you can talk much more, and in my opinion talking is an important part of learning a language. Lastly, they can explain things so you can understand the best.
