Dear Tom,
How are you? Hope you are doing well. I can't wait to see you again.
A new shopping centre opened near me and it had a big opening ceremony. They invited bands and there was a bunch of street food stands.
In the shopping centre ther're a lot of chlothing stores like H&M and pull&bear. There is also a big electronics store, a supermarket and a few restaurants.
I don't need to order my clothes from the internet anymore. Now I can try them on before buying them.
However, I'm not gonna go to the supermarket too often. I like the local grocery store. I like to see my town growing, we needed this new shopping centre. It is going to create new jobs in the town.
Although I hope it wont be too much competition for the local stores.
When you are here we can go and try out the new restaurants and buy new clothes from the new stores.
I can't wait to meet you again.
Take care,
Dávid

Nowadays many people lives their social life on the internet. This way you can meet new people who live far from you. You can connect with distant family members, and friends from an other countries. You can also use your phone as a credit card or a travel pass. However staring at a screen all day is a bad habit. Looking at a small screen excessively can damage your eyes. These days people have worse memory, because instead of trying to remember their shopping list, or upcoming events, or anyting, they write everything in our phone. Some people also use their phone for gaming, wich can be very addictive. I think it's the best to try not to use your phone at home.
