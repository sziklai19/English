Dear Tom,
How are you? Hope you are doing well. I can't wait to see you agin.
A new shopping center opened near me and it had a big opening ceremony. They invited bands and there was a bunch of street food stand.
In the shopping center ther's a lot of chlothing stores like H&M and pull&bear. There is also a big electronics store, a supermarket and a few restaurants.
I don't need to order my clothes from the internet anymore. Now I can try on them before buying.
However, I'm not gonna go to the supermarket too often. I like the local grocery store. I like to see my town growing, we needed this new shopping center. It is going to create new jobs in the town.
Althoufh I hope it wont be too much competition for the local stores.
When you will be here we can go and try out the new restaurants and buy new clothes from the new stores.
I can't wait to meet you agin.
Take care,
Dávid

Nowadays many people live their social life on the internet. This way you can meet new peoples who live far from you. You can connect with distant family members, and friends from an other country. You can also use your phone as a credit card or a travel pass. However stearing at a screen all day is a bad habit. Excessively looking at a small screen can damage your eyes. These days people have worst memory, because insted of trying to remember our shopping list, or upcoming events, or anyting, we write everything in our phone. Some people also use their phone for gaming, wich can be very addictive. I think it's best to try not to use your phone at home.
