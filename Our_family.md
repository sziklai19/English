Our family is rather small. Unfortunately, I grew up as an only child. I would always have liked to have a brother or a sister, with whom I could have shared my problems.

Our family is quite large. I have got two elder brothers, both of whom work and live a happy family life with their wives and children. I have also got a sister, who is younger than me and she is still single. She lives with my parents, who are quite old and need looking after.

I am married and I live with my husband and two daughters.

I am single and I live with my parents. My father is an old-age pensioner but my mother still goes out to work.

to go out to work

I trust my husband and he trusts me. We get on very well with each other. We both work outside the home and also share looking after our two daughters. As we have the same interests, we go out everywhere together. We don't argue much even if we have had some tough times.

I don't get on very well with my parents; we often quarrel about unimportant things. They are both caring but not very tolerant.

Our parents don't live with us but we are in close contact with them. We often go and see them at the weekends. They are over the moon whenever we are there and they love to spend the Sunday afternoons playing with their grandchildren. Occasionally, we have lunch with them too, when my mother prepares the children's favourite food.

My sister is divorced and lives with her six-year-old son. She is a very busy person and we don't often see her.

I don't have very strong family ties and I am not in close contact with many of my relatives. I haven't seen some of my nephews or nieces for ages, nor do I keep in touch with my cousins. At times I bump into them in the street and then we talk about what has happened to us since we last met.

I have a strong sense of family, which I have inherited from my mother. My home and my immediate family mean a great deal to me and my extended family is very important as well. I like to see them as often as I can.

What do you look like?

I am in my late twenties / teens. I am quite tall and I am heavily-built / slightly-built, but I have rather narrow / wide shoulders. I am a little overweight / I think I am just the right weight.

I have straight / wavy medium-length hair / dark hair. / I have a short beard and a moustache. My eyes are blue / brown and I wear glasses.

I have got a rather long/ an oval face with a strong chin, a big / small nose and big / small ears. I have thin/full lips and an expressive face.

My face changes a lot when I smile. I have a high forehead: I like to think that it looks intelligent. I don't think I am good-looking, but I am not all that bad-looking either. I probably look a bit older than I am.
